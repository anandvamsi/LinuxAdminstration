/dev/shm is nothing but implementation of traditional shared memory concept.
It is an efficient means of passing data between programs. One program will create a memory portion, which other processes (if permitted) can access.
This will result into speeding up things on Linux.

shm / shmfs is also known as tmpfs, which is a common name for a temporary file storage facility on many Unix-like operating systems. 
It is intended to appear as a mounted file system, but one which uses virtual memory instead of a persistent storage device.
