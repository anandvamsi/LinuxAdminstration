UserAdministration

lastlog,finger,id,w 



When we run the ‘useradd‘ command in the Linux terminal, it performs the following major things:
It edits /etc/passwd, /etc/shadow, /etc/group, and /etc/gshadow files for the newly created user accounts.
Creates and populates a home directory for the new user.
Sets permissions and ownerships to the home directory

# useradd rajesh

/etc/passwd
Username: User login name used to login into the system. It should be between 1 to 32 characters long.
Password: User password (or x character) stored in /etc/shadow file in an encrypted format.
User ID (UID): Every user must have a User ID (UID) User Identification Number. By default, UID 0 is reserved for the root user and UIDs ranging from 1-99 are reserved for other predefined accounts. Further UIDs ranging from 100-999 are reserved for system accounts and groups.
Group ID (GID): The primary Group ID (GID) Group Identification Number stored in the /etc/group file.
User Info: This field is optional and allows you to define extra information about the user. For example, the user’s full name. This field is filled by the ‘finger’ command.
Home Directory: The absolute location of the user’s home directory.
Shell: The absolute location of a user’s shell i.e. /bin/bash.
