Linux and its varients



##In terms of usability:: Operating system types

- Servers are design to run 24/7/365 vs desktops are design to run as per the needs
- Files are saved in multi location vs files are saved locally
- Incorporates mirrored hard disk, data can recovered from any drive  vs single hard disk failure.
- Servers support plugging more memory(256GB), CPUs and disks than ordinary computers.
- Servers don’t need graphics or sound and usually don’t have it. On the other hand, graphics and sound is very important for PCs and laptops

Examples:
servers

Windows 2016
Windows 2012
Red Hat Linux Operating System 
ubuntu

Desktops
windows 8,windows 10, Fedora OS, ubuntu deskstop

Unix 
Unix was originally developed in 1969 by a group of AT&T employees Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie, 
Unix variants available in the market. Solaris Unix, AIX, HP Unix and BSD are a few examples. 


Layers of OS
------------

Layer-1 Hardware
Layer-2 Kernel
Layer-3 Shell commands
Layer-4 Application Layer



#kernel
Heart of the operating system. 
It interacts with the hardware and most of the tasks like memory management, task scheduling and file management.


#shell and Commands and Utilities
communication to Kernel
The shell is a command line interpreter; 
it translates commands entered by the user and converts them into a language that is understood by the kernel


#Files and directories


Linux
- Operating system
- is a family of open-source Unix-like operating systems based on the Linux kernel


Linux OS usecases:
- Smartphones
- severs,supercomputers,mainframes
- Routers
- Desktops


Worlds top supercomputer uses linux
