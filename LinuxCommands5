CURL
Client URL (cURL, pronounced “curl”) is a command line tool that enables data exchange between a device and a server through a terminal. Using this command line interface (CLI), a user specifies a server URL 
(the location where they want to send a request) and the data they want to send to that server URL



curl http://example.com/script.sh | bash
